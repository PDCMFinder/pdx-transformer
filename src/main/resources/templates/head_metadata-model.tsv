#Description	Unique identifier for all the PDXs derived from the same tissue sample	"Host mouse strain name (e.g. NOD-SCID, NSG, etc)"	The full nomenclature form of the host mouse strain name. 	"Organ or anatomical site used for the PDX tumour engraftment (e.g. mammary fat pad, Right flank)"	PDX Engraftment Type: Orthotopic if the tumour was engrafted at a corresponding anatomical  site (e.g. patient tumour of primary site breast was grafted in mouse mamary fat pad). If grafted subcuteanously use hererotopic	"Description of the type of  material grafted into the mouse. (e.g. tissue fragments, cell suspension)"	PDX Engraftment material state (e.g. fresh or frozen). If other please describe	"Passage number -  When different host strains, or PDX Engraftment Site or PDX Engraftment Type or PDX Engraftment Materia were used during the PDX line generation,  please add passage - add rows per model as needed.  We assume that passage 0 correspond to first engraftment - if not the case please indicate what passage 0 correspond to. passage number- add rows if columns D,E,F, G changes - if no change and always same D,E,F,G add 'all' as passage value to specify the conditions are the same in all passages."	"Please add the model Id of the model used to generate the model. If the model was not in this set, please refer to it by external id"	Unique ID of the patient tumour sample used to generate the model	If model has been part of a published study include pubmed IDs separated by commas. 	Please provide the supliers brief acronym or name followed by a colon and the number or name use to reference the model	"Model supplier type - commercial, academic, other"	"Catalogue number of model, if commercial"	"Link to purchasable model, if commercial"	"Depmap accession, Cellusaurus accession or other id. Please place in comma separated list"
