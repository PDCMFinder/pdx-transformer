Description	Identifier of the sample from any patient tissue or PDX derived sample from which OMIC data was generated	The orgin of the sample - xenograft (extracted from PDX model) or patient (directly extracted from the patient)	"Indicate the passage number of the sample where the PDX sample was harvested (where passage 0 corresponds to first engraftment). Not applicable if the sample_origin is patient, leave blank in this case."	"The anatomical site from which the xenograft sample was extracted from after engraftment.Not applicable if the sample_origin is patient, leave blank in this case."	Unique identifier for all the PDXs derived from the same tissue sample. This needs to be unique to represent an aggregated PDX line : combination between a mouse strain and a unique grafted tumour sample	"Host mouse strain name (e.g. NOD-SCID, NSG, etc)- When different mouse strain was used during the PDX line generation, please add a new row with correposding passage numbers.For first engraftment (passage 0: We need strain,engraftment site, type,material, status. We also require this information for any passage where information is shared (OMIC or drug) - We assume that passage 0 correspond to first engraftment - if not the case please indicate what passage 0 correspond to."	The full nomenclature form of the host mouse strain name. Use Not Specified if unknown.	"Please use one of: ""cytogenetics"" (FISH IHC), ""microsatellite"" (microsatellite stability/instability),  ""copy number alteration"" (CGH, CNA from NGS), ""mutation"" (mutation data dervied from NGS or PCR), ""expression"" (for RNA expression generated from NGS , microarray or qPCR), if not on the list please contact PDX Finder team , we will create a term."	"The name of the platform technology used to produce the molecular characterisation, (eg. IJAX CTP http://www.pdxfinder.org/platform/jax-ctp/)."	"The type of technology underlying the platform (eg. targeted next generation sequencing, sanger sequencing, whole exome sequencing, qPCR, expression microarray), no specific ontology yet but will build from commonly used vocabulary"	Include any information suitable to characterise the platform used. Include the link to a commercial gene panel or a gene list if a custom panel was used 	Any protocol filename for the analysis of the data generated by the platform - should describe the algorythm made to make the calls if relevant - example of the data required is shown here:  http://www.pdxfinder.org/platform/ircc-gene-panel/	"Filename of the file containing the processed data - VCF file for variation, TSV for expression data, methylation data - file to be supplied independentely with the metadata for inclusion in portal"	"Is the raw data, (eg. fastq files) accessible? Are they available to be deposited into molecular archives? Please answer yes if that can be shared to PDX Finder users"		URL from PDX Finder where protocol can be found- DO NOT FILL THIS COLUMN- PDX FiNDER TEAM SPECIFIC-
