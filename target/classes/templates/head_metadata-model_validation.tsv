Field	model_id	validation_technique	description	passages_tested	validation_host_strain_full
Description	Unique identifier for all the PDXs derived from the same tissue sample	"Any technique used to validate PDX against their original patient tumour, including fingerprinting, histology, immunohistochemistry - if several technique were used to validate one model, please list all  techniques/descriptions/passage used. Add rows as necessary."	"Short description of what was compared and what was the result: (e.g. high, good, moderate concordance between xenograft, 'model validated against histological features of same diagnoses' or 'not determined') - It needs to be clear if the model is validated or not."	Provide a list of all passages where validation was performed. Passage 0 correspond to first engraftment (if this is not the case please define how passages are numbered).	"Validation host mouse strain, following mouse strain nomenclature from MGI JAX: https://www.jax.org/jax-mice-and-services/customer-support/technical-support/genetics-and-nomenclature"
