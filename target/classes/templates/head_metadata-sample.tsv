#Description	Unique anonymous/de-identified provider ID for the patient. ID's must be defined in the patient sheet.	Unique ID of the patient tumour sample used to generate PDX(s)	"Date of collections - if this is not available please indicate in column E, F collection events and the elapsed times between the collection. Important for understanding the time relationship between models generated for the same patient."	"IF DATE ENTERED IN collection_date DO NOT FILL  order collection 1 correspond to the 1st time a patient was sampled to generate a PDX, subsequent collection events are incremented by 1"	"IF DATE ENTERED IN collection_date DO NOT FILL,  provide the time difference between the 1st collection event and the current one (in months) - collection event 1  should be 0, collection event 2 should be 6 if 6 months have elapsed between collection 1 and  collection 2 and collection event 3 should be 9 if 9 months have elapsed between collection 1 and collection 3 "	"Patient age at collection. Can be exact age or binned in 10 y group (1-9, 10-19, 20-29, ...)"	diagnosis at time of collection of the patient tumour used in xenograft  - use a NCIT ontology term when possible	Collected tumour type.	Site of the primary tumor where primary cancer is originating from (may not correspond to the site of the current tissue sample). No abbreviations.	Site of collection of the tissue sample (can be different than the primary site if tumour type is metastatic)	Method of collection of the tissue sample	Stage of the patient at the time of collection. Should be in the format of the stage classification	Stage classification system used to describe the stage. Add the version if available.	The implanded tumour grade value.	"Grade classification correspondingly used to describe the stage, or Not Specified Add the version if available."	"Positive virology status at the time of collection. Any relevant virology information which can influence cancer like EBV, HIV,HPV status."	"Outcome of mutational status tests for the following genes: BRAF, PIK3CA, PTEN, KRAS"	"Is patient treatment information available and shareable? If yes fill out following treatment columns: treatment_naive_at_collection, treated_at_collection, treated_prior_to_collection."	"Was the patient treatment naive at the time of collection? This includes the patient being treated at the time of tumour sample collection and if the patient was treated prior to the tumour sample collection. The value will be ""yes"" if either treated_at_collection or treated_prior_to_collection are ""yes""."	"Was the patient being treated for cancer at the time of tumour sample collection. This includes any of the following: radiotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, homorno-therapy."	"Was the patient treated prior to the tumour sample collection. This includes any of the following: radiotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, homorno-therapy."	Patients response to treatment.	Unique identifier for all the PDXs derived from the same tissue sample. Needs to be unique to represent an aggregated PDX line : combination between a mouse strain and a unique grafted tumour sample
